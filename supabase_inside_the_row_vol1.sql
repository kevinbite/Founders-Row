  E'Who Was Richard Russell — and Wow, Do I Owe Him a Lot\n\nIn 1997, I was a 22-year-old rookie at A.G. Edwards — a desk, a phone, and a bit of curiosity. An older commodities trader named Doug Cownd took me under his wing and required one thing of me: read Richard Russell''s Dow Theory Letters every week and report back what I was learning. Each week, from his desk in La Jolla, Russell mailed a simple letter to thousands of investors. No marketing, no graphics, no hype — just truth, observation, and calm perspective. Over time, he became one of the most trusted financial voices of the twentieth century — the man investors turned to when they wanted clarity over noise. Russell didn''t build a fund or an empire; he built trust through consistency. For 57 years he studied behavior and cycles. What made him powerful wasn''t prediction — it was perspective. That lesson stuck with me. I''ve spent 30+ years studying people, not markets — and what I see now feels just as clear as any cycle I''ve ever watched.\n\n\nThe Pattern I See: Fitness Fatigue with a huge Wellness Appetite\n\nFitness fatigue is real. The pendulum is swinging toward something softer, deeper, and more sustainable — a wellness appetite rooted in calm, community, and recovery. For years, we built spaces that trained the body. The next decade will be about training the mind and caring for the system that carries it. This is the shift. It''s already happening — from biohacking to breathwork, from burnout to balance. And the founders who build for it will define the next cycle.\n\n\nDream Digital Meditation: The Third Act\n\nThe world wants experiences. Record-breaking concert tours. Sold-out stadiums. People want to feel something real — to be part of a shared moment instead of another algorithmic feed. Run clubs are getting thousands of young people every week. The shift is happening. That same energy is fueling wellness and human performance. Dream Digital Meditation is going to be built on that current. It isn''t a product or a service (it is both actually… but that''s not the point lol); it''s an experience — the most ambitious one I''ve ever worked on. A physical and digital space where technology isn''t the distraction; it''s the bridge back to internal presence, a stillness we all need. I view Dream Digital as my third act. The first was Orangetheory. The second was SweatHouz. Dream will be the third — and absolutely not my final act. Dream Digital will be our first major investment at Founders Row, scheduled to close by year-end 2025. Founders Row, as General Partner, will own (estimated) 27 percent of the Class A equity at a $33 million enterprise value, equating to approximately $8.6 million of equity value for Founders Row the GP (and all of you reading this). If you own 2 percent of Founders Row, that''s roughly $170,000 of value in our first investment. To be clear, we will own 27% of this and we will have $0 capital of our own (GP) in the deal. We considered investing $250k from the GP funds, but the demand has been such, that I wanted to make sure others got a piece of this one. Dream''s Venice, CA flagship will open in early 2026, followed by Atlanta, Boston, and Austin. Every detail — from sound and light to aroma and design — is crafted to make people feel again. It''s fitness for the mind, built to restore and reconnect. This is gonna be a fun one… get ready!\n\n\nThe Founders Row Focus\n\n• Dream Digital Meditation — (currently in fundraise)\nOur first major investment (by year-end 2025). Founders Row to own 27% Class A equity at a $33M EV (~$8.6M value to FR). Venice flagship build-out will be underway within weeks. The design, systems, and staff are in full "build mode." Looking for real estate, building systems, website, app, etc… aiming to open #1 in May 2026.\n\n• SculptHouse — (Term sheet signed, going to PSA)\nFounders Row is acquiring 30% ownership for a $1.5M commitment across three $500k tranches over 26 months, with an option to purchase an additional 10% for $750k within 36 months. With 2 open studios (Atlanta and Dallas) and producing more than $1MM profit in 2025, SculptHouse has one of the best founders I''ve met. We plan to open 3 more studios, with a goal of $2MM free cash flow by 2027, paying FR ~$500k annually. FR will also receive a platform-support fee of $15k per month beginning in Jan 2026. What makes SH different? The retail boutique contributes ~50% of total profit. A brilliant model and differentiated fitness brand.\n\n• Peachtree Demolition (PD) — (Term sheet and PSA signed)\nFounders Row is acquiring 40% ownership through a $2M five-year note guaranteed by FR22. PD produces ~$1.3M annual free cash flow on ~$6.5M revenue and anchors the Founders Row platform with recurring yield. Peachtree Demo will pay Founders Row ~$600k per year while debt costs an average of $260k annually. Expected topline > $8M in 2026.\n\n• Hot Box Pretzels — (Final docs being signed this week)\nFR to own ~20% (non-dilutive) for brand development, growth, and marketing. This is a great story and one we will share publicly in the next few weeks. Roman Desmond, the 21-year-old founder, DM''d me in 2023 telling me he had dropped out of college and had listened to all my podcasts. He asked for a Zoom. Of course I said yes! Today he is doing $25k a week in sales. Unreal story!\n\n• Kühler Technologies — (Final docs pending)\nFounders Row acquiring up to 10% (non-dilutive) equity for strategic guidance, capital planning, and distribution growth in performance recovery and bio-optimization. Founders trading equity for time, perspective, and an old "wise" voice (quotation marks intentional).\n\n\nBy the Numbers (as of November 2025)\n\n• 5 portfolio brands\n• 3 signed (Dream, SculptHouse, PD)\n• 2 in final documentation (Hot Box, Kühler)\n• $12MM in estimated equity value across all FR22 holdings\n• $600k in annual fees from Peachtree Demo\n• $180k in annual fees from SculptHouse\n• 0% management fees — only performance and platform revenue\n\n\nJamie''s Closing Note\n\nRichard Russell taught me that clarity beats noise — every time. This moment feels like that lesson coming full circle. Founders Row isn''t chasing trends; we''re backing founders who see around corners, and sometimes we see around the corner oursleves....I mean Dream Digital is seeing around an entire NYC block!!',
