# Investor Decks

## Instructions

Place your investor deck PDF file in this folder with the filename:

**`investor-deck.pdf`**

This file will be displayed to all authenticated investors in the Investor Portal.

## File Requirements

- **Format:** PDF only
- **Filename:** Must be exactly `investor-deck.pdf` (lowercase, with hyphen)
- **Recommended size:** Under 20MB for optimal loading performance

## Security Features

The PDF viewer includes the following protections:
- ✅ View-only mode (no download button in viewer)
- ✅ Right-click disabled
- ✅ Text selection disabled
- ✅ Rendered as canvas (harder to extract)
- ✅ Only accessible to authenticated investors

## Updating the Deck

To update the investor deck:
1. Delete or replace the existing `investor-deck.pdf` file
2. Add your new PDF with the same filename
3. Changes will be reflected immediately (no code changes needed)

## Multiple Decks (Future Enhancement)

If you need to display multiple decks or versioned decks in the future, let me know and I can enhance the system to support:
- Multiple deck files with different names
- Quarterly or dated versions
- Deck selection interface
- Historical deck archive
